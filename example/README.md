## Example document for mini run

This directory contains an example input file to the pipeline which is run with the [run\_example.sh](https://github.com/jakelever/pgxmine/blob/master/run_example.sh) script. The input file contains a [single abstract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26736037/) which has had the PubTator entities matched in its text. This functionality is now part of the [BioText](https://github.com/jakelever/biotext) project.
